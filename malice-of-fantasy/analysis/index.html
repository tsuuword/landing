I really didn't want to write this… Q & A Section

This is an extra section.

Q: How can someone realise that Sumizora Mary is a fantasy?
A: If they realise it, they die, so they can't. Sumizora Mary was the first fantasy Harley had and the name was just his idea. Everyone believed in its existence based on that word. So, the name was only shared verbally, and each person had a different recognition for Sumizora Mary (Refer to Chapter 1 handout). If a genius player were to notice it... …they'd die!

Q: What's the line of reasoning behind the third chapter?
A: In the first half of the third chapter, the players search for the culprit who stole the Philosopher's Stone from the courtyard. 
To steal the Philosopher's Stone, one needs to be alone in the hospital ward and then alone in the courtyard. 
Therefore, only someone who can take these actions is capable of stealing it. 
By scrutinising everyone's actions on July 6th, it's evident that only Hoshino can steal it. 
Was Hoshino cornered? Oops :P

Q: What was happening in the second half of the third chapter?
A: In the first half of the third chapter, Honda Kazu realises that the illusion of the Philosopher's Stone disappeared while watching the surveillance cameras in the staff room, and he notices the ongoing investigation to find the culprit. 
Since Taiyo believes someone stole it, if they realise the Philosopher's Stone doesn't exist in the hospital, they'll realise it's an illusion. So, Honda Kazu frames Sumizora Mary for the theft and quickly prepares investigation reports, unlocks the staff room, messes up the library, and hides.​

Q: Are the documents and materials new because Honda Kazu prepared them?
A: That's correct. All the documents and materials prepared by Honda Kazu are labelled as "New".

Q: How can someone notice the ladder on the floor?
A: Scroll down <span onclick="window.open('../mysterious-room', '_blank')" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;">???</span> page for the answer!

Q: Is there a Pegasus?
A: No, there isn't.

Q: Is there magic?
A: No, there isn't.

Q: Is there a Philosopher's Stone?
A: No, there isn't.
