―――2035. July 6th. Early morning.
"Hey! What are you doing! You can't just enter the library without permission!"

―――It's Doctor Malice's voice!
The four hurriedly tried to escape, but of course, there was nowhere to run, and they were quickly found.

<span style="color: black">Harley: "Miss Mal-...ry! I'm sorry, I asked them to help me. They didn't do anything wrong!"</span>
Harley bowed his head and apologised.

<span style="color: black">Yuki: "Miss Mal-....ry I wanted to help Harley because he was in trouble. I'm sorry for entering the library without permission."</span>
Yuki also apologised sincerely.

<span style="color: black">Hoshino: "Miss Mal-....ry. You can scold us later but please listen to Harley's story. I beg of you."</span>
Hoshino also bowed with a sincere attitude.

<span style="color: black">Taiyo: "Malice...no, Miss Mary!! I'm asking you too!! Harley is in trouble!"</span>
Taiyo pleaded with his hands together.

Seeing the four like that, Teacher Maris smiled a little, then opened her mouth as if to hide it.
"Who's Malice! I’ll have you all write a reflection essay later ...Anyway, let's hear Harley's story for now".

We told her that Pegasus had disappeared, and that Pegasus neither got injured nor sick, and that it had been about three years since Harley first met Pegasus... Pegasus had a lifespan of about three years and usually quietly met its end elsewhere without anyone realising.

From the information the four gathered in the library, they already knew the answer.
But not wanting to admit it, they believed that Doctor Malice would give them a better answer and asked her.

Doctor Malice shook her head quietly and said to Harley, "Let's make a grave for Pegasus". Harley, being smart, naturally understood the meaning of Doctor Malice's words, but without saying anything, he ran off.
