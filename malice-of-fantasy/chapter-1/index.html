―――2035. July 6th. Early morning.

In the hospital bathed in morning sunlight, the four woke up. Harley began speaking with a slightly more serious tone than usual.

"There might be something wrong with Pegasus. What should I do?"

If Harley is in trouble, of course, we want to help.
However, for the four who have been raised in the hospital since birth, we have little knowledge about Pegasus.
Fortunately, there is a library in this hospital, and there are various books there.
Let's research about Pegasus and clarify the cause.

In Chapter 1, you can read books in the library.

The books each person reads in the library are listed in the 【Specific Information】 section.

Chapter 1 is a tutorial. Let's exchange as much information as possible and practice speaking.
In Chapter 1, only group meetings (conversations involving everyone) are possible. Let's discuss what happened to Pegasus.

Now, the 7 minutes timer for Chapter 1 starts.









……When 7 minutes have passed, please proceed to the next step.
