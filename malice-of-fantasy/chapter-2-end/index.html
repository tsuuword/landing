"Hey! What are you doing? It's not safe to be out at this hour!"

――― It's Doctor Malice's voice!
The four of them panic and try to run away, but of course, there's nowhere to escape, and they're quickly caught.
								
<span style="color: black">Harley: "Miss Mal-...ry! I'm sorry. There was something I really wanted to investigate, and even though I'm the oldest, I went out without permission... It's not their fault!"</span>
Harley bows his head and apologises.

<span style="color: black">Yuki: "Miss Mal-...ry. It was my idea, I was desperate to prove I wasn't lying"</span>
Yuki also apologises sincerely.

<span style="color: black">Hoshino: "Miss Mal-...ry. We'll accept the scolding later, but for now, please help us prove that Yuki isn't lying"</span>
Hoshino also bows with a determined stance.

<span style="color: black">Taiyo: "Malice... I mean, Miss Mary!! You wouldn't like it if Harley and Yuki became enemies, right!? Please, help us out!!"</span>
Taiyo clasps his hands together in an earnest plea.

Seeing the four like this, Doctor Malice smiles in exasperation.
"Who's Doctor Malice? You'll all be writing two pages of reflection later, alright? …… Anyway, let's hear Yuki's story"

Based on Yuki claims to be able to use magic and not being able to, the medical record about Yuki found in the records room, and the book about magic users found in the library, the answer was already apparent from the information the four had gathered within the hospital.

Yuki truly was a magic user, and had lost the ability to use magic upon turning 10 years old.

Doctor Malice remarked grinningly, "Is the misunderstanding cleared up now? Yuki wouldn't lie to Harley, right?"

Yuki blushes and returns to the hospital ward. This time, the four of them truly fall asleep.
