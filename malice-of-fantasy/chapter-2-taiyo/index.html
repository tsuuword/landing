「Taiyo」

Harley ran out of the library. It's because Pegasus died... Guys don't want to show tears to girls you know! 
After a little while, when I returned to the hospital ward, Harley smiled as if nothing had happened and said, "Sorry about earlier".

Before long, an adult in a white coat came to fetch us. "It's time," they said in a dispassionate tone, and we moved to the study room.  We studied under the watchful eye of adults in white coats in a room surrounded by glass. This had been our everyday routine for as long as we could remember, and it was "normal" for us.

I'm not that good at studying, and being watched all the time is tiring. Doctor Malice is the only one who doesn't look at us with such eyes, she's strict but... a good supervisor.

―――Night falls, and another typical day is coming to an end.

Talking with the three of them before bed is so much fun. I slowly fell asleep.

"Taiyo, Taiyo!!"
I had a bad dream. Hoshino's voice reached me. I opened my eyes slightly, and Hoshino was shaking my body.
Looking out the window, it was pitch black, and I could tell it was still late at night.
"What... at this hour?" I asked Hoshino, who informed me that Harley and Yuki were no longer in the hospital ward.

I remember the dream I just had. It was a dream where the treasure we were secretly hiding, the "Philosopher's Stone", was gone.
"Maybe, did they go to get the 'Philosopher's Stone' that we're hiding!?"

I said that as I was half asleep. If I think about it calmly, there's no way Harley and Yuki would steal.
Perhaps my words made Hoshino uneasy too, so we decided to go to the courtyard.

As we walked through the dimly lit corridor towards the courtyard, someone came running.
It was Harley. Harley passed by us without saying anything and went back to the hospital ward.
He looked unusually angry. I wonder what happened. As I was puzzled, Yuki also appeared from the courtyard.

"I might have made Harley hate me…... I'm not lying, I want you all to believe me.
I want us to help prove it together."

Yuki's eyes glistened, and she said so to us in a voice that seemed about to cry.
Harley wouldn't make a girl cry.
Even though he always tells me to be kind to girls.
What happened?

Hoshino and I waited for Yuki to calm down a bit and decided to listen to her story.

Because, I don't want to see Harley and Yuki fighting.
