As the four of them were talking in the hospital room, the door opened. 
It was the adult in the white coat... …Honda Kazu.

"Sumizora Mary has stolen documents from the hospital", he said.

"There have been many suspicious activities, but actions were taken before evidence could be presented."

"The Philosopher's Stone is undoubtedly the work of Sumizora Mary."

He spoke dispassionately, without emotion. The four listened to his words absentmindedly. After delivering the message, the man in the white coat left the room.

It was Doctor Malice who stole the Philosopher's Stone.

The evidence found after searching the hospital and the fact that Doctor Malice, who had been present every day, suddenly disappeared were more than enough to believe those words.

With Harley's Pegasus gone, Yuki unable to use magic, Taiyo and Hoshino's Philosopher's Stone stolen, and now even Doctor Malice went missing...

That day, the four of them fell asleep without saying a word.
