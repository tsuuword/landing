「Hoshino」

Under the big tree in the courtyard, we buried a box with the Philosopher's Stone in it. It's a secret between Taiyo and me. However, about a week ago, I might have been seen by Yuki when I was digging alone to see the Philosopher's Stone. 
Yuki seemed unaware, but I'm worried if she found out about the stone.

The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary stone said to grant any wish. Taiyo and I wanted to create the Philosopher's Stone! So, we polished a stone that was in the courtyard to create it. 
To be precise, it was created by chance. We don't feel like creating the same thing anymore. 
Of course, not every wish comes true…... but it shines beautifully in the dark. Taiyo said to me, "Hoshino, look! It's shining like the Philosopher's Stone in the picture book!", when I looked at the stone, it was indeed shining beautifully, so we decided to bury it in the courtyard as our own treasure.

To prevent it from being easily dug up, Taiyo used the shovel he had to bury it a little deeper.

"Someone stole the Philosopher's Stone!!", Taiyo is making a fuss in the hospital ward. The Philosopher's Stone was indeed missing from the box Taiyo brought. It was definitely there two nights ago.

Who, and why would they do such a thing? The only ones who should know the hiding place of the Philosopher's Stone are Taiyo and me... No, maybe Yuki knows as well.

Taiyo and I, our own treasure, stolen... I absolutely cannot forgive the person who stole it!!!

Find the person who stole the Philosopher's Stone.

【Events of Yesterday (July 6th)】

◆Around 6:00
All four of us went to research about Pegasus for Harley’s sake. Even though it's the end of its life, it would be sad if a friend were to die...

◆8:00
I was called by a man in a white coat to study in the study room. Today, the only one monitoring was that man.

◆12:00
After finishing studying, we returned to the hospital ward as a group of four and had lunch.
My shovel was definitely in the hospital ward at that time.

◆13:00~
Harley and Yuki left the hospital ward. I folded origami with Taiyo. Taiyo always creates things that surprises me, "You can make that with origami!?". I can't afford to lose!

◆15:00~
I lost track of time while making things. Taiyo was making the Eiffel Tower with origami. Impressive, Taiyo is so cool. My creation of the Milky Way is also well done. After playing with origami, Taiyo left the hospital ward. Since I didn't have anything particular to do, I tidied up the room alone.

While tidying up, I saw Harley walking down the hallway towards the study room. I wonder if he's going to study; he's always so diligent.

◆16:00
Yuki and Taiyo returned to the hospital ward. Later, Harley returned from the study room.

◆17:00~
We were called by an adult in a white coat to the study room as a group, and we studied while being monitored by the man in the white coat.

◆21:00~
We all returned to the hospital ward, had dinner together and went to sleep

◆Around 24:00
I woke up Taiyo and we headed to the courtyard, passing by Harley. For Yuki’s sake, we proved to everyone that she could use magic.

◆Around 1:00 AM
We all returned to the hospital ward and went to sleep.
