「Yuki」

"Someone stole the Philosopher's Stone!!", Taiyo is causing a commotion in the hospital room. The box Taiyo brought was empty. 

The box is covered in dirt. Did someone bury it somewhere? 
Come to think of it, about a week ago, Hoshino seemed to be digging something in the courtyard.

Taiyo is incredibly angry, as I've never seen before, and Hoshino also seems strange. 
If someone really did steal it, then there must be a reason. 
Last night, when I was suspected of lying by Harley, everyone cooperated to help me.

If we can't find the culprit who stole the Philosopher's Stone, suspicion will linger forever

……I hate that.

Let's find the culprit and have them confess. We can surely make things right. After all, we've been living together like a family for so long.

<span style="color: #FF8080">(Goals)</span>

Find the person who stole the Philosopher's Stone.

【Events of Yesterday (July 6th)】

◆Around 6:00
All four of us went to research about Pegasus for Harley’s sake. It seems Pegasus died of old age. 
Harley is sad, and so am I.

◆8:00
I was called by a man in a white coat to study in the study room. Today, the only one monitoring was that man.

◆12:00
After finishing studying, we returned to the hospital ward as a group of four and had lunch.

◆13:00~
Harley left the hospital ward. I also left the hospital ward and headed to the library. On the way, I saw Harley in the courtyard from the hallway... I'll leave him alone for now. 
I entered the library and read academic books.

◆15:00~
While concentrating on reading, Taiyo entered the library. 
It seems like he's reading a book about architecture. I see, it seems like something boys would like. 
I returned to reading my own book.

◆16:00~
After finishing the book, I returned to the room with Taiyo. 
Hoshino was alone in the room. After a while, Harley returned from the study room.

◆17:00~
We were called by an adult in a white coat to the study room as a group, and we studied while being monitored by the man in the white coat.

◆21:00~
We all returned to the hospital ward and had dinner together.

◆24:00
I followed Harley, who left the hospital ward, to the courtyard. 
I was about to be misunderstood as a liar by Harley because I couldn't use magic, but thanks to everyone, the misunderstanding was resolved. 
…...I'm really relieved.

◆Around 1:00 AM
We all returned to the hospital ward and went to sleep.
