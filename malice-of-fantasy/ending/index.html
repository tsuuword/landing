Slowly and cautiously, the four descended into the underground. The ladder, seemingly endless, finally reached its end.

There were lights scattered around the underground, suggesting electricity was running through.

<span style="color: black">Harley: "What should we do from here? It's my first time leaving the hospital, and I'm not sure..."</span>
As Hale whispered anxiously, a voice echoed in the underground passage.

<span style="color: black">Yuki: "It's okay, Harley. We'll somehow manage with all of us here"</span>
Yuki proceeded cautiously along the underground passage.

<span style="color: black">Hoshino: "Where are we? Is Doctor Malice okay?"</span>
Hoshino looked at Taiyo and asked.

<span style="color: black">Taiyo: "Forget about that person! She stole our treasure!!"</span>
Taiyo raised his voice as if recalling something.

―――From the depths of the underground passage, footsteps could be heard. 

It was not just one or two pairs, there seemed to be around ten people.
Instinct warned them to flee. They searched for an escape route, but the ladder they came down was the only way.

There was a discarded box that seemed big enough for small children to fit in. Without prior discussion, Harley and Yuki thought it was natural for the older ones to act accordingly.

They shoved Hoshino and Taiyo into the box and closed the lid, only telling them, "Don't make a sound".

A few seconds later, individuals dressed in military attire appeared in front of Harley and Yuki.

Hoshino and Taiyo, unable to do anything, trembled in the darkness.


In 2035, a certain country's research facility was bombed. 
Two subjects (Harley and Yuki) who were in the vast underground facility were abducted by an enemy nation.

In 2036, Taiyo and Hoshino discovered the research facility in the vast underground.

In 2038, they gained control of the underground research facility and expanded it.

In 2039, the Third World War broke out.

In 2042, the world's population halved.

In 2044, Taiyo and Hoshino completed a nation underground.

In 2045, the bio-weapon development facility was bombed, and a virus spread.

In 2046, the world's population was reduced to one-tenth.

In 2047, the virus continued to spread worldwide.

In 2048, with no signs of the virus weakening, the remaining human population migrated underground.

In 2050, all entrances to the surface were closed except for one, and underground shelters were expanded.

In 2070, the tower 「Hyperion」 leading to the surface was completed.

A few seconds later, individuals dressed in military attire appeared in front of Harley and Yuki.

Although they couldn't understand each other's language, they didn't seem to intend harm.
They restrained the two and then left the underground passage.

In 2035, a certain country's research facility was bombed. Vast underground facilities are discovered, and two test subjects are captured.

In 2036, the two test subjects, Hale and Yuki, join a biological weapon development research team.

In 2039, the Third World War broke out.

In 2042, the world's population halved.

In 2044, Harley and Yuki completed the development of the virus.

In 2045, the bio-weapon development facility was bombed, and a virus spread.

In 2046, the world's population was reduced to one-tenth.

In 2047, the virus continued to spread worldwide.

In 2048, worldwide economies came to a complete halt.

In 2049, people with antibodies to the virus began to appear throughout Japan.

In 2050, Japan's population decreased to about 100,000.

In 2100, the virus, now called「Malice」pervades Japan, causing the atmosphere to glow purple.

In 2101, the remaining humans in Japan established villages throughout the country, slowly developing them.

In 2500, Japan's population reached one million, gradually reclaiming civilization using remnants of old technology.

In 2800, nations were established in Fukuoka, Osaka, Hokkaido, Nagoya, and Tokyo.

In 2850, the population of Tokyo, now the【Tokyo Nation】, reached 200,000.

In 3000, various research efforts in 【Tokyo Nation】 were aimed at eradicating the virus 「Malice」 and restoring lifespan. As a result, the nation evolves into a scientifically advanced and rational society.
