The four, having noticed the existence of the basement from the hospital floor plan in the archives, began searching for a route to the underground.

From the architecture history found in the library,
『Every building can be erected based on precise calculations. It's fascinating to think about why it's constructed that way. Rooms constructed to be especially sturdy likely hide something』

With the glass in the study room broken, they could now access the room further in.

Upon reaching the room, they noticed something odd about the floor.

Recalling the various tools like shovels, hammers, and crowbars in the staff room's storage shelf, they decided to fetch them.

Outside, there was an unusually loud commotion... …a sense of impending doom.

Pooling their strength, they broke through the floor, revealing a ladder leading down to the basement. In the darkness, with no idea where it might lead, the four, who had never left the hospital before, hesitated.

"Run!"
―――They heard Doctor Malice’s voice.

Of course, it was just their imagination, as they scanned their surroundings and found no trace of her. Yet, emboldened by the voice, the four resolved to descend the ladder.

Descending cautiously down the long, dark ladder...

... A loud noise echoed from above. They could infer that the hospital was collapsing.

*Click* *Clack* *Click* *Click* *Clack*

In the staff room, a man in a white coat was illuminated by the glow of the monitors as he typed on the keyboard. Numerous screens displayed various areas of the hospital captured by surveillance cameras.
―――I am complicit in the study of demons

My country is about to start a war. For that, we need superior weapons compared to other nations.
My mission was to create individuals with superior intellect to develop such weapons.

...…Stimulate abnormal development of the brain, primarily the frontal lobe, artificially creating 'geniuses'.

Children who knew nothing were operated on, nurtured into geniuses in this hospital.

All for this country, my heart has died long ago.
The surgeries seemed successful, but one day, side effects of brain surgery were discovered.

"Doctor, there's a fairy in the courtyard!!!"

Around the time Subject Number 001「Akane」turned seven, she suddenly started saying such things.
When I went to the courtyard, of course, there was nothing like that. Fairies are creatures of fairy tales, so it's natural.
When I informed Akane of this fact, she clutched her head... and died.

Subject Number 002「Masami」, Subject Number 003「Tamai」, Subject Number 004「Airi」
All of them witnessed non-existent entities, and upon realising they didn't exist, they died while clutching their heads.

I decided to name this phenomenon 【Fantasy Syndrome】

Children who underwent brain surgery suddenly harbour fantasies one day. They believe in the existence of things that aren't there. And when they understand that these fantasies don't exist, they die.

I devised a plan to liberate the children from their fantasies. It involved convincing them that the fantasies they saw were indeed real and that there were other reasons for their disappearance. I failed many times, and many children died.

……There's no turning back now. As a researcher, I have my pride. Only four children survived. Since I've sold my soul to the devil, if I can't make even one of them succeed, then truly I am just a murderer.

Subject Number 028「Harley」,
The fantasy of Pegasus disappears. 
I successfully convinced him that Pegasus died of old age by providing various materials in the library. 
July 6th. Successfully liberated from the fantasy.

Subject Number 055「Yuki」,
Harboured a fantasy of being able to use magic. Despite urging her not to use it again, I failed. Changed to Plan B. The plan proceeded smoothly, and she believed that magic users lose their magic at age 10. 
July 6th. Successfully liberated from the fantasy.

Subject Number 099「Hoshino」 and Subject Number 100「Taiyo」,
Harboured a shared fantasy. They created the fictional tool called the Philosopher's Stone. Shared fantasies often lead to discrepancies in stories, and subjects harbouring shared fantasies have all failed to break free in the past. Successfully convinced them that the Philosopher's Stone was stolen by Sumizora Mary. 
July 7th. Successfully liberated from the fantasy.

These fantasies the children see suddenly disappear one day without warning.

To deal with that, surveillance cameras were installed throughout the hospital, constantly monitoring.

One day, Harley embraced the fantasy of a Pegasus, which then suddenly disappeared. I had prepared non-existent encyclopaedias, like one on mythical creatures. If something happened, I left them in the library, and the children would deduce that Pegasus died naturally.

Yuki admired magic. Although I thought simply banning the use of magic would solve the issue, she ended up trying to use it herself. To prevent her from realising that magic was a fantasy, I induced the belief that magic would become unusable at the age of 10.

Lastly, the troublesome issue was the shared fantasy. Taiyo verbalised a fantasy that 「the stone was shining」 and Hoshino began to see the same thing. Shared fantasies often lead to discrepancies in stories since each person's vague image contributes to the creation of the illusion. Taiyo and Hoshino didn't notice anything strange because they had hidden the Philosopher's Stone in a box in the courtyard.

I induced the belief that Sumizora Mary had stolen the Philosopher's Stone, thus successfully freeing them from the shared fantasy.

And then―――

With Sumizora Mary gone, the biggest problem was resolved.

The shared fantasy that all four harboured「Sumizora Mary」disappeared.

What form did Sumizora Mari take in the eyes of the children? I don't even know what her name looked like, as she existed only in the children's fantasies. But whenever they talked about her, the children seemed truly happy.

……With this, the four geniuses are complete.

What will become of this country, of the world, from now on? Was what I did right?

I hope there is promise for the children's future.

As I finished typing, the man in the white coat took a deep breath and slumped into his chair.

―――The next moment, a loud explosion rang out.
