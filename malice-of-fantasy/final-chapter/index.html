With the sudden explosion and tremor, you all jumped awake.

Wondering what happened, the four of you rushed out into the hallway. Lights and fixtures had fallen, making the corridor a mess, but the building itself seemed intact.

A faint smell of burning filled the air. Whether something was on fire or not was unclear, but it was likely that everyone would perish if things continued like this.

Where were the adults? 
Regardless, you all had to cooperate and escape from here.

You may have lost many things over these past few days, but you all are... …a family.

The four of you set out to explore the hospital and aim to escape.
In this final chapter, you can enter any location.

Work together to search while moving to the same location and find a way to escape.
You can enter any room.

Additionally, the evidence (specific information or investigated information) found so far (Chapters 1~3) is listed below, and you can use them as well.

The time limit is 10 minutes. Please discuss and decide on the escape plan together within the time limit.

【Chapter 1：List of evidences】

・Guidebook 「About the Hospital」
A new book. It's about this hospital.
『A hospital created for children who lost their parents at a young age. Here, even children without money can receive treatment』

・Picture book 「The Girl and the Magic」
An old picture book. I feel like we read it together when we were young. It's about a girl who admired a magician.
The magician can only learn one spell, and it's a story of the girl's struggle about which spell to learn.

・Library Room: History of Architecture
『All buildings are constructed with perfect calculations. It's interesting to think about why they're made that way. Something is likely hidden in rooms built especially sturdy』

・Picture book 「Wishes and the Philosopher's Stone」
An old picture book. I feel like we read it together when we were young. 
It's a story about the Philosopher's Stone, which is said to grant any wish. 
It explores various wishes and the events that follow, skillfully portraying both the beautiful and ugly sides of human nature.

・Picture book 「The Boy and the Pegasus」
An old picture book. I feel like we read it together when we were young. It's about a boy who saves an injured Pegasus and becomes friends with it.
The scene of riding on Pegasus and flying through the sky was everyone's dream.

・Encyclopedia 「Encyclopedia of Mythical Beasts」
A new encyclopaedia containing various animals. Opening the page about Pegasus, there was information about Pegasus.
『Pegasus is a short-lived creature, with a lifespan of about three years. To prevent those it trusts from realising its mortality, it has a habit of flying away to unseen places and quietly sleeping』

・Medical book「Treatment of Mythical Beasts」
A new medical book containing various treatment methods for animals. Opening the page about Pegasus, there is some information about Pegasus.
『Pegasus does not get sick. Its healing ability is high, and most injuries heal instantly, so there is usually no need for treatment』

・Memo 「Phoenix」
An old note found tucked into a library book.
『The Phoenix suddenly disappeared. Is there some reason behind it? Let's investigate』. The note had 「Yu」written on it. It's the name of a child who was discharged four years ago.

【Chapter 2：List of evidences】
・Library Room 1「Regarding Magic 1」
A new book. It's about magic users.

『Magic user can only use one type of magic.

It's an innate ability,
not something acquired through training.

One day, they will suddenly awaken to that power』

・Library Room 2「Regarding Magic 2」
A new book. It's about magic users.
『Magic can only be used by young girls. Once they turn 10 years old, they lose the ability to use magic』


・Hospital Ward 1「Someone's Diary」
A diary written on aged paper.
It was found under the bed.
『I suddenly couldn't use magic. What's happening?』
「Miyabi」is written on the paper. …...The name of a child who was discharged a long time ago.

・Hospital Ward 2「Yuki's Diary 1」
An old diary written in Yuki's handwriting.
『I used magic for the first time. I was able to talk to my mother, whom I had never met before. 
Since you can only speak once to the same soul, even though I can't see her again, 
I was happy just to talk to her once』

・Hospital Ward 3「Yuki's Diary 2」
An old diary written in Yuki's handwriting.
『I was told by a man in a white coat that I must not use magic anymore, 
and I must never tell anyone that I can use it. 

It seems that magic users are persecuted outside, 
and it would be a big problem if it were known. 

Unless it's absolutely necessary, 
I'll keep the ability to use magic a secret……』

・Reference Room 1「Medicial Record：Regarding Yuki」
Since the reference room was unlocked, I entered inside.
Medical Record: A new document labelled "Regarding Patient Yuki"
『Patient Yuki has awakened as a magic user. Due to persecution against magic users, it is necessary to keep the fact of being a magic user hidden』


・Reference Room 2「Medicial Record：Regarding Harley」
Since the reference room was unlocked, I entered inside.
Medical Record: A new document labelled "Regarding Patient Harley"
『Patient Harley seems to be loved by animals. Even the reserved Pegasus, who doesn't easily warm up to people, seemed to have grown attached to him』

・Reference Room 3「Medicial Record：Regarding Hoshino and Taiyo」
Since the reference room was unlocked, I entered inside.
Medical Record: New document labelled "Regarding Patients Hoshino and Taiyo"
『Patients Hoshino and Taiyo are both skilled with their hands and can create anything. Their future looks promising』​

【Chapter 3：List of evidences】
・Staff Room：The staff room was unlocked. Since there was no one inside, we quietly entered. There was a storage shelf. On it were various tools like shovels, hammers, and crowbars. …..The shovel feels a bit dirty. There was another door at the back of the staff room, but it was locked.


・Staff Room：The staff room was unlocked. Since there was no one inside, we quietly entered. There was an attendance log. On July 6th, only "Honda Kazu" and "Sumizora Mary" seem to have been on duty. Honda Kazu is probably the adult in the white coat who was here yesterday. If I remember correctly, his name tag had "Honda Kazu" written on it.

・Staff Room：The staff room was unlocked. Since there was no one inside, we quietly entered. There was a fresh new paper on the desk labelled "Investigation Report". 『Regarding Sumizora Mary: Recently, items have been disappearing frequently from the staff room. When investigated by a detective regarding Sumizora Mari, it seems she is burdened with a large amount of debt』

・Staff Room：The staff room was unlocked. Since there was no one inside, we quietly entered. There were many monitors, and only one of them was powered on. Surveillance camera footage was being displayed. The footage showed the patient room, and we could also view the recording from July 6th. From 12:00 to 17:00 on July 6th, it seems that Hoshino didn't leave the hospital ward at all.

・Reference Room：The reference room is unlocked. It had been ransacked by someone. There was a note on the floor. "Sumizora Mary stole the documents and escaped. …...There may be other victims as well."

・Reference Room：The reference room is unlocked. It had been ransacked by someone. There was a floor plan of the hospital on the shelf. It seems there is a basement in the hospital. It's unclear where it connects from.

・Library Room：Gemstone Encyclopaedia：There was a new book. I opened the page for the Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone, a luminous and shining gemstone. Only top-tier artisans can create it, and they can only do so when they perform miracles. While the idea of granting any wish is nothing more than a fairy tale, the Philosopher's Stone holds high value as a gemstone and is traded at high prices. Selling it could fetch enough money to live a lifetime of luxury.
