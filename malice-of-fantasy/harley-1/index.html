「Harley」

I'm Harley, 11 years old. I seem to be the oldest in this hospital. 
There were a lot of kids my age, but they've all been discharged.

The three others in my room, Yuki, Hoshino, and Taiyo, have been together for years. 
Yuki is a year younger than me. She's smart, always outscoring me. 
Hoshino and Taiyo are both 9 years old. Even though they're two years younger, they're skilled. They fold incredibly intricate things from scrap paper.

…...I have a secret. I've been meeting a Pegasus in the courtyard. Pegasus is like a horse with white wings and a horn. I rescued it when it collapsed in the courtyard about three years ago. After that, it started visiting me from the sky occasionally when I was alone in the courtyard. 
I've been sneaking out at night to see it more often. 
Of course, I can't talk to Pegasus, but I feel like if I told anyone, it won't come anymore, so I've kept it a secret.

All the adults here look at us with cold, mechanical eyes. However, there's one exception, our supervisor, Sumizora Mari. 
Unlike the others, she immediately scolds us, saying “You shouldn't do that!”,  whenever we do something wrong.

I happened to come across the word "malice" in an English dictionary. It means ill will. The four of us laughed and associated it with our constantly scolding supervisor. So, we started calling her "Doctor Malice". She always gets mad when we call her that.

About a week ago, Pegasus stopped coming. It's never happened before. 
I wonder if something happened?

If Pegasus is in trouble, I want to help, even if it means never seeing it again.
…...I'll talk to everyone. Yuki, Hoshino, and Taiyo will definitely help.

【Specific Information】

・Guidebook 「About the Hospital」
A new book. It's about this hospital.
『A hospital created for children who lost their parents at a young age. Here, even children without money can receive treatment』

・Picture book 「The Girl and the Magic」
An old picture book. I feel like we read it together when we were young. It's about a girl who admired a magician.
The magician can only learn one spell, and it's a story of the girl's struggle about which spell to learn.
