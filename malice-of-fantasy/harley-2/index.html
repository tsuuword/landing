「Harley」

I dashed out of the library in a whirlwind of emotions and returned to the hospital ward. After shedding a few tears, I began to feel calmer. 
When everyone returned to the room, I tried to smile as usual and said, "Sorry about earlier".

Before long, an adult in a white coat came to fetch us. "It's time", they said in a cold tone, and we were escorted to the study room. As usual, we studied under the watchful eye of adults in white coats in a room surrounded by glass. This was our everyday routine, a "normal" part of life for us.

While this environment wasn't pleasant, I didn't dislike learning. 
Despite being strict and often scolding us, Doctor Malice was different from the other adults. She didn't peer at us coldly from behind the glass. 
She treated us like fellow human beings.

―――Another typical day was drawing to a close.

The four of us in the same room got along well, like a real family. 
As the night grew quiet, unable to sleep, I quietly slipped out of the room.
…...Pegasus had died of old age. I understood that and didn't want to worry everyone anymore. However, I wanted to say goodbye by looking up at the night sky one last time. 
I went to the courtyard and gazed up at the sky.

"Harley, are you okay?"
Out of nowhere, Yuki called out to me. I turned around, surprised to see her.
"Yeah, thanks, Yuki. I'm okay now" 
I replied with a smile, trying my best not to worry her.

―――Yuki stood up as if she had made up her mind. She looked me straight in the eye and began to speak.

"...Harley, I've been keeping this a secret, but I can use magic"
Magic? I've heard of it before, but really? Before I could ask, Yuki interrupted me.

"It's a magic that lets you talk to deceased people or animals just once. Magic users are persecuted in the outside world, so the adults told me not to tell anyone, but I couldn't bear to see you suffering"
Yuki's expression was serious, and I wanted to believe her words. 
If I could talk to Pegasus just once more, I would want to say "thank you."

Yuki recited something like a spell. 
She repeated it a few times, but nothing happened.

"...It's okay, Yuki" 
She wasn't at fault; I understood that. She was trying to comfort me. But I couldn't forgive that lie. I stared at her and then left the courtyard.

For some reason, Hoshino and Taiyo were in the hallway, but I didn't feel like talking to them, so I went straight back to the hospital ward.
