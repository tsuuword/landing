「Harley」

"Someone stole the Philosopher's Stone!!", Taiyo is causing a commotion in the hospital ward. The contents of the box Taiyo brought were empty. 
The box is covered in dirt. Did someone bury it somewhere? 
Come to think of it, three days ago, I felt like Taiyo was digging something in the courtyard.

I don't really understand what the Philosopher's Stone is, but Taiyo seems filled with anger, and Hoshino also seems terribly upset. 
As Taiyo is saying, if someone stole it, there must be a reason. 
After spending time together like a family, I don't want it to end like this.

For that reason, I need to listen carefully to Taiyo's story and find the thief.

Yesterday, I misunderstood and got angry at Yuki, but with everyone's cooperation, we were able to resolve it.

Find the person who stole it and make them apologise properly…... It will surely be okay.

Find the person who stole the Philosopher's Stone.

【Events of Yesterday (July 6th)】

◆Around 6:00
We researched about Pegasus together as a group of four for my sake. Pegasus... is no longer here.

◆8:00
I was called by a man in a white coat to study in the study room. Today, the only one monitoring was that man.

◆12:00
After finishing studying, we returned to the hospital ward as a group of four and had lunch.


◆13:00~
I wanted to calm down a bit, so I left the hospital ward and headed to the courtyard. I almost cried when I remembered that Pegasus was gone, but I held back my tears as I looked up at the sky.

◆15:00~
When I closed my eyes, memories with Pegasus kept replaying in my mind. No, if I stay here, I'll start crying right away. 
I decided to go to the study room and do some studying, leaving the courtyard behind. 
Hoshino was alone in the hospital ward, looking for something. 
I went into the study room to study. I'm already losing in terms of grades to Yuki, who's younger than me; I have to do my best.

◆16:00~
After finishing self-study, I returned to the hospital ward, where Hoshino, Taiyo, and Yuki were.
	
◆17:00~
We were called by an adult in a white coat to the study room as a group, and we studied while being monitored by the man in the white coat.

◆21:00~
We all returned to the hospital ward and had dinner together.

◆24:00
Unable to sleep, I quietly slipped out of the hospital ward. 
...Pegasus passed away from old age. 
I understood that, and I didn't want to worry everyone any further. But, I wanted to say goodbye by looking up at the night sky one last time. As I went to the courtyard and gazed up at the sky absentmindedly, Yuki came.
I misunderstood, thinking Yuki lied about being able to use magic to talk to Pegasus, and I got angry at Yuki. Everyone proved that Yuki wasn't lying.

◆Around 1:00 AM
We all returned to the hospital ward and went to sleep.
