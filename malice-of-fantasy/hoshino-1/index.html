「Hoshino」

I'm Hoshino, 9 years old. I'm the youngest in the hospital.
There were lots of kids my age, but they all got discharged. It's lonely.

The three others in my room, Harley, Yuki, and Taiyo, have always been together. 
Harley is the oldest at 11 years old. He's like a big brother, reliable and kind.
Yuki is 10 years old, and she's like a big sister. She's incredibly smart and always gets the top scores. 
Compared to them, Taiyo is still a kid. Even though we're both 9 years old and only a few months apart, he acts like he's older than me. 
He's good with his hands and plays origami with me. There are definitely good things about him too.

…...Harley has been acting strange lately. He's been absent-minded and just stares into space.

Maybe it's hard for him to rely on someone younger like me, but Harley, Yuki, and Taiyo have been like family to me since we were born. 
If they're in trouble, I want to help.

All the adults here look at us with cold, mechanical eyes. 
However, there's one different adult. Sumizora Malli, who supervises us. 
Unlike the others, she immediately gets mad whenever we do something, saying “You shouldn't do that!”. 

Harley told us, "I happened to come across the word 'malice' in an English dictionary. It means ill will." The four of us laughed and associated it with our constantly scolding supervisor. So, we started calling her ‘Doctor Malice'. 
She gets even angrier when we call her that.

One day, Harley came to us with a gloomy face.
"Actually, there's something I've been keeping a secret from everyone."

I kinda sensed it, but I was glad he came to us for advice since it was hard for me to ask.

"I've been secretly meeting Pegasus in the courtyard. But it stopped coming recently... If Pegasus is in trouble, I want to help. I want to know what happened. Will you all help me?"

Of course, if anyone's in trouble, I want to help. It's only natural.

Find out why Pegasus disappeared.

【Specific Information】

・Picture book 「Wishes and the Philosopher's Stone」
An old picture book. I feel like we read it together when we were young. 
It's a story about the Philosopher's Stone, which is said to grant any wish. 
It explores various wishes and the events that follow, skillfully portraying both the beautiful and ugly sides of human nature.

・Encyclopedia 「Encyclopedia of Mythical Beasts」
A new encyclopaedia containing various animals. Opening the page about Pegasus, there was information about Pegasus.
『Pegasus is a short-lived creature, with a lifespan of about three years. To prevent those it trusts from realising its mortality, it has a habit of flying away to unseen places and quietly sleeping』
