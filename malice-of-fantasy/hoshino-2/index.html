「Hoshino」

Harley ran away from the library. It's because he found out that his friend Pegasus had died.
After a while, when we returned to the hospital ward, Harley smiled as if nothing had happened and said, "Sorry about earlier".

Before long, an adult in a white coat came to fetch us. "It's time", they said in a dispassionate tone, and we moved to the study room. We studied while monitored by adults in white coats in a room surrounded by glass. This had been our everyday routine for as long as we could remember, and it was "normal" for us.

Even on such normal days, I get exhausted, but what made me happy was that everyone was there. 
And there was Doctor Malice, who, among the adults, scolded and laughed with us on the same level. 
Taiyo and I love creating things, and actually, we have a secret just between the two of us.

―――Night falls, and another typical day is coming to an end.

I was truly happy when the four of us talked before going to bed. 
For some reason, I had a bad feeling that day and woke up late at night. 
Harley and Yuki weren't in bed. I thought about going to look for them, but going alone was a bit scary, so I woke up Taiyo.
"What... at this hour?" At first, Taiyo seemed reluctant, but when I explained the situation, he got up.

"Maybe, did they go to get the 'Philosopher's Stone' that we're hiding!?"
Taiyo said in a hurry.
There's no way Harley and Yuki would steal our treasure. 
However, when Taiyo said that, it still bothered me, so I left the hospital ward with Taiyo to check the Philosopher's Stone buried in the courtyard.
……Because that's a secret just between Taiyo and me.

As we walked through the dimly lit corridor towards the courtyard, someone came running. Harley passed by us and went back to the hospital ward.
He seemed angry. I wonder what happened. While I was puzzled, Yuki appeared from the courtyard.

"I might have made Harley hate me…... I'm not lying, I want you all to believe me.
I want us to help prove it together."
Yuki said to us in a voice that seemed about to cry.

Taiyo and I decided to wait for Yuki to calm down a bit and listen to her story.

Because, I don't want to see Harley and Yuki fighting.
