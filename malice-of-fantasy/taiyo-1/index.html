「Taiyo」

I'm Taiyo, 9 years old! I'm the same age as Hoshino, but I'm actually two months older, so Hoshino is the youngest. 
There were a lot of kids our age, but they all got discharged.

The three others in my room, Harley, Yuki, and Hoshino, have been together since birth. 
Harley is the oldest at 11 years old. He's like a big brother, kind, smart, and always helps us out when we're in trouble. 
Yuki is 10 years old. She's super pretty and always the top genius in our class. Hoshino should learn from her. 
Hoshino and I are the same age... Well, I'm technically older, right? But age-wise, we're the same, so we play together a lot. 
She's really good with her hands and makes amazing things when we do origami together. 
I love making things too, so it's fun to play with Hoshino. ...Not that I like her or anything.

……Harley seems to be troubled lately. Sometimes he looks up at the sky and sighs. 
I wonder what's wrong? If he needs me, I'm always ready to help!

All the adults here look at us with cold, mechanical eyes. I'm used to it by now. But there's one weird adult, Sumizora Marry, who supervises us. Unlike the others, she immediately gets mad whenever we do something wrong, saying “You shouldn't do that!”. 

Harley told us, "I happened to come across the word 'malice' in an English dictionary. It means ill will". The four of us laughed and associated it with our constantly scolding supervisor. So, we started calling her 'Doctor Malice'. She gets even angrier when we call her that.

One day, Harley came to us with a gloomy face.
"Actually, there's something I've been keeping a secret from everyone."

What could it be? Does it have to do with what he's been troubled about lately?

"I've been secretly meeting Pegasus in the courtyard. But it stopped coming recently... If Pegasus is in trouble, I want to help. I want to know what happened. Will you all help me?"

I don't really understand, but if Harley's in trouble, I'll definitely help! 
Leave it to me!

【Specific Information】

・Library Room: History of Architecture
『All buildings are constructed with perfect calculations. It's interesting to think about why they're made that way. Something is likely hidden in rooms built especially sturdy』

・Picture book 「The Boy and the Pegasus」
An old picture book. I feel like we read it together when we were young. It's about a boy who saves an injured Pegasus and becomes friends with it.
The scene of riding on Pegasus and flying through the sky was everyone's dream.
