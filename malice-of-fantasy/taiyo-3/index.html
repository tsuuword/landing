「Taiyo」

In the morning, I woke up earlier than usual.
Remembering the silly dream I had yesterday, I slipped out of the hospital ward alone and headed to the courtyard.

Underneath the large tree in the courtyard, I buried a box with the Philosopher's Stone in it.
The philosopher's stone is a legendary stone that is said to grant any wish, but of course, it's fake.
Hoshino and I talked about wanting to make a philosopher's stone! We polished the stone in the courtyard and made something that looked like it.
To be precise, it was made by chance.
Of course, it doesn't grant any wish... but it does shine beautifully in the dark. It's amazing that we were able to make something like this.
"We'll make it our own treasure!", and we decided to bury it in the courtyard.

Using the shovel I brought from the room, I dug under the big tree in the courtyard and found a box.
When I opened the box... the philosopher's stone was gone. I'm sure it was there two nights ago, Hoshino and I confirmed it.

Who and why would someone do this?
The only ones who should know the hiding place of the philosopher's stone are me and Hoshino.

…...No, come to think of it, three days ago, I think Harley saw me digging a hole in the courtyard to see the philosopher's stone. I thought I wasn't found out at that time, but...

Anyway, it's certain that it's gone. I can never forgive anyone who steals someone's treasure!

Find the person who stole the Philosopher's Stone.

【Events of Yesterday (July 6th)】

◆Around 6:00
All four of us went to research about Pegasus for Harley’s sake. Even though it's the end of its life, it would be sad if a friend were to die...

◆8:00
I was called by a man in a white coat to study in the study room. Today, the only one monitoring was that man.

◆12:00
After finishing studying, we returned to the hospital ward as a group of four and had lunch.
My shovel was definitely in the hospital ward at that time.

◆13:00~
Harley and Yuki left the room.
I folded origami with Hoshino. Hoshino always creates things that surprises me, "You can make that with origami!?". I can't afford to lose!

◆15:00~
I lose track of time when making things. Hoshino was creating the Milky Way with origami. 
Isn't this already in the realm of art? 
Well, my "Eiffel Tower" isn't bad either.
I needed to go to the toilet, so I left the hospital ward. On the way to the toilet, I saw Harley in the courtyard from the hallway. Is he still thinking about Pegasus?
I arrived at the toilet. 
Hoshino is amazing. What should I create next? Should I go to the library and look at picture books to find something to create?

When I entered the library, Yuki was reading alone. She’s reading a difficult book. No wonder she always gets almost perfect scores on tests.
I looked up various buildings from different countries in an old building encyclopaedia. Maybe I'll create the Tower of the Sun next.

◆16:00
I returned to the hospital ward. Hoshino was alone in the hospital ward.
Later, Harley returned from the study room.

◆17:00~
We were called by an adult in a white coat to the study room as a group, and we studied while being monitored by the man in the white coat.

◆21:00~
We all returned to the hospital ward and had dinner together.

◆Around 24:00
I was awakened by Hoshino and headed to the courtyard, where I saw Harley returning to the room.
For Yuki's sake, we will prove together that she was able to use magic.

◆Around 1:00 AM
We all returned to the hospital ward and went to sleep.
