「Yuki」

I'm Yuki, 10 years old. I'm a veteran in this hospital. 
There were a lot of kids my age, but they've all been discharged.

The three others in my room, Harley, Hoshino, and Taiyo, have been together for years. 
Harley is a year older and a kind boy. He always helps me when I'm in trouble. 
Hoshino and Taiyo are both 9 years old. They're skilled with their hands and fold incredibly intricate things from scrap paper. I wonder if they'll do something related to craftsmanship in the future? Studying is my only strength, and I always get the highest scores, but I don't have any other special talents.

…...Harley has been acting strange lately. He sneaks out of the room at night alone. 
But he doesn't say anything to me, and it feels awkward to ask him. 
If Harley, who always helps me, is in trouble, I want to help him. 
But he seems to be enjoying himself and doesn't seem to be in trouble.

All the adults here look at us with cold, mechanical eyes. However, there's one exception, our supervisor, Sumizorra Mary. 
Unlike the others, she immediately scolds us, saying “You shouldn't do that!”,  whenever we do something wrong.

Harley told us, "I happened to come across the word 'malice' in an English dictionary. It means ill will". The four of us laughed and associated it with our constantly scolding supervisor. So, we started calling her "Doctor Malice". She always gets mad when we call her that. Angry Malice is scary, but, with her beautiful black eyes, she always looks after and takes care of us.

One day, Harley came to us with a gloomy face.

"Actually, there's something I've been keeping a secret from everyone."

We knew, but we pretended not to and listened to his story.

"I've been secretly meeting Pegasus in the courtyard. But it stopped coming recently... If Pegasus is in trouble, I want to help. I want to know what happened. Will you all help me?"

Harley seems to always want to help someone. I want to help Harley, who always helped me. 
Of course, I'll cooperate.
