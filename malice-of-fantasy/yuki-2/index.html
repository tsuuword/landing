「Yuki」

Harley ran out of the library. He's the oldest, so he probably didn't want to show his tears to everyone. After a while, when he returned to the hospital ward, Harley smiled and said, "Sorry about earlier", as usual.

Before long, an adult in a white coat came to fetch us. "It's time", they said in a cold tone, and we moved to the study room. As usual, we were studying, monitored by adults in white coats in a room surrounded by glass. This had been our everyday routine for as long as we could remember, and it was "normal" for us.

However, we couldn't help but dislike the cold stares from the adults, and we wanted to know why we were the only ones who couldn't leave the hospital. No matter how many times we asked Doctor Malice for the answer, she only looked apologetic and didn't tell us anything. I liked studying because I was good at it, but I didn't like this environment.

―――Night fell, and another typical day was drawing to a close.

I was truly happy when the four of us talked before going to bed. 
Late at night, Harley quietly slipped out of the room. 
...I had somehow noticed that something was wrong with Harley. 
When I went to the courtyard, I found Harley looking up at the night sky.

"Harley, are you okay?"
When I called out to him, he looked surprised and then quickly calmed down.

"Yeah, thanks, Yuki. I'm okay now" 
Seeing Harley smile sadly, I made up my mind.

―――Let's use magic.

"...Harley, I've been keeping this a secret, but I can use magic"
Harley tried to ask something, but I interrupted and continued.

"It's a magic that lets you talk to deceased people or animals just once. Magic users are persecuted in the outside world, so the adults told me not to tell anyone, but I couldn't bear to see you suffering…
Once, I used this magic to talk to my deceased mother"

I recited the spell.

…….Pegasus's soul didn't appear. Why!? 
I repeated it several times, but nothing happened.

"...It's okay, Yuki" 
Harley stared at me and left the courtyard.

Why are you looking at me like that? Believe me, Harley, I really could use magic. I didn't lie.

As I hurried to follow him, Hoshino and Taiyo called out to me in the hallway.

Why were they here at this hour? 
The fear of being disliked by Harley overwhelmed me more than any questions. 
So, instead, I decided to tell them what had happened in the courtyard.
